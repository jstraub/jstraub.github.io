Julian Straub is a Lead Spatial AI Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs Research](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/) (RLR) working on Computer Vision and 3D Perception. 
Before joining RLR, Julian obtained his PhD on [Nonparametric Directional Perception](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/112029/1006379939-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) 
from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), where he was advised by [John W. Fisher III](https://sli.csail.mit.edu/people/johnfisher) and
[John Leonard](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JLEONARD@MIT.EDU) within the [CS and AI Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (CSAIL). 
On his way to MIT, Julian graduated from the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de) (TUM) and the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu) with a M.Sc. 
He did his Diploma thesis in [Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/steinbach-eckehard)'s group with the [NavVis](https://www.navvis.com) founding team and in particular with [Sebastian Hilsenbeck](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=TenY_v0AAAAJ).

## Research

My current research interest are problems that involve 3D localization, recognition and description of objects and surfaces from egocentric video streams in scalable and generalizable ways.
